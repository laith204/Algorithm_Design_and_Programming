# Algorithm Design and Programming

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains assignments focused on **fundamental data structures** and **algorithm design**. The goal is to develop efficient implementations using **arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees** while reinforcing programming concepts such as **memory management, recursion, and data organization**.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python  
- **Concepts Covered**: Data structures, recursion, memory management  

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered
- ðŸ”¹ **Stacks** â€“ Implemented using both arrays and linked lists  
- ðŸ”¹ **Queues** â€“ Implemented using both arrays and linked lists  
- ðŸ”¹ **Binary Trees** â€“ Implemented with insertion, search, and traversal methods  

## âœ… Completion Status
This repository is actively maintained, with potential future updates adding **optimizations, additional algorithms, and data structure enhancements**.
